//! # Pumpkins
//!
//! A pumpkin is a cultivar of winter squash that is round with smooth, slightly ribbed skin, and is most often deep
//! yellow to orange in coloration.[1] The thick shell contains the seeds and pulp. The name is most commonly used for
//! cultivars of Cucurbita pepo, but some cultivars of Cucurbita maxima, C. argyrosperma, and C. moschata with similar
//! appearance are also sometimes called "pumpkins".
